# FlandersBOT
### A bot for sharing your favourite references! 

A discord bot with commands surrounding The Simpsons, Futurama and Rick and Morty.

FlandersBOT provides commands for The Simpsons, Futurama and Rick and Morty quoting/searching/content. FlandersBOT uses [Frinkiac](https://frinkiac.com/), [Morbotron](https://morbotron.com/) and [Master of All Science](https://masterofallscience.com/) to provide commands for both random and searchable Simpsons, Futurama and Rick and Morty images/gifs with their appropriate quotes embedded.

[![Discord Bots](https://discordbots.org/api/widget/221609683562135553.svg)](https://discordbots.org/bot/221609683562135553)

## Usage
The bot commands can be executed using several different methods/prefixes, to minimise clashing with other discord bots. The command can be prefixed with ned and a space ("ned "), an @mention to the bot followed by a space ("@FlandersBOT#0680 ") and some variations of diddly and doodly for when you really want to flaunt those Flanders-isms.

**Usage Examples:**

`@FlandersBOT#0680 info`  
`ned info`  
`diddly info`  
`doodly info`  
`diddly-info`  
`doodly-info`

*All examples above are valid methods of executing any command below.*
