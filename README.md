# FlandersBOT
A discord bot built in python using the discord.py API with commands surrounding The Simpsons, Futurama and Rick and Morty.

FlandersBOT is entirely focused toward providing commands for The Simpsons, Futurama and Rick and Morty quotes/content. FlandersBOT uses Frinkiac, Morbotron and Master of All Science to provide commands for both random and searchable Simpsons, Futurama and Rick and Morty images/gifs with their appropriate quotes embedded.

# Requirements
Requires discord.py to be installed.
The bot also depends entirely on https://frinkiac.com/, https://morbotron.com/ and https://masterofallscience.com/ for all of its commands and may fail if the API for these sites change.
