# FlandersBOT
A discord bot built in python using the discord.py API with commands surrounding The Simpsons, Futurama and Rick and Morty.

Unlike my other discord bot, FlandersBOT is more specialised and is entirely focused toward providing commands for The Simpsons, Futurama and Rick and Morty quotes/content.

# Requirements
Requires discord.py to be installed.
The bot also depends entirely on https://frinkiac.com/, https://morbotron.com/ and https://masterofallscience.com/ for all of its commands and may fail if the API for these sites change.

## Commands
### !simpsons

Will post a random Simpsons quote with accompanying picture.

### !simpsons <quote to search for>

Searches for a Simpsons quote using all text following the command, grabs the first result and sends the resulting quote with accompanying picture.

### !futurama

Will post a random Futurama quote with accompanying picture.

### !futurama <quote to search for>

Searches for a Futurama quote using all text following the command, grabs the first result and sends the resulting quote with accompanying picture.

### !rickandmorty

Searches for a Rick and Morty quote using all text following the command, grabs the first result and sends the resulting quote with accompanying picture.
